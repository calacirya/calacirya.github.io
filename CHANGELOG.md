# [Calacirya GitHub Page](https://github.com/calacirya/calacirya.github.io) Change Log

This is the change log to Calacirya GitHub Page. For further info on this project, see the [ReadMe file](README.md).

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Principles of a change log, excerpted from [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/):

 * It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.
 * Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).
 * One sub-section per version.
 * List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).
 * Write all dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. (Example: `2012-06-02` for `June 2nd, 2012`.) It’s international, [sensible](http://xkcd.com/1179/), and language-independent.
 * Explicitly mention whether the project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
 * Each version should:
   * `List` its release date in the above format.
   * `Group` changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:
     * `Added` for new features.
     * `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
     * `Deprecated` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
     * `Removed` for deprecated features removed in this release.
     * `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
     * `Security` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.
